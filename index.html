              Season 1:
The first season of Loki follows the story of the titular character played by Tom Hiddleston,
 who is a variant of the God of Mischief created when he steals the Tesseract during the events of Avengers: Endgame. Loki is apprehended by the Time Variance Authority (TVA),
 an organization that governs the multiverse and maintains the proper flow of time.

Loki is put on trial for his crimes of disrupting the sacred timeline,
 but he manages to escape with the TVA's specialized agent, Mobius M. Mobius (played by Owen Wilson). Loki learns about the existence of alternate timelines and different versions of himself known as variants. Together with Mobius, they try to catch a dangerous variant who is causing chaos across the timeline.

Throughout the season, Loki goes through a transformative journey, questioning his identity and purpose. He encounters different variants of himself, including a female Loki variant named Sylvie (played by Sophia Di Martino), with whom he forms a unique bond. They uncover a conspiracy within the TVA and discover the true nature of the multiverse.

In a thrilling finale, Loki and Sylvie confront the mastermind behind the TVA, a variant of Loki known as "He Who Remains" (played by Jonathan Majors). They are given a crucial choice that will affect the fate of the multiverse. Ultimately, Sylvie kills He Who Remains, causing the multiverse to branch out into infinite timelines.

           <h3>updated:</h3>
        <img src="koie.jpg" alt="loki picture" width="220">
           In the past, the Time Variance Authority (TVA) attempts to apprehend Loki while he is uncontrollably warping across time in their headquarters. In the present, Loki reunites with Mobius M. Mobius and warns him of the threat posed by the many variants of He Who Remains, the TVA's creator. Concurrently, TVA General Dox has several TVA hunters arm themselves, ostensibly to find Sylvie, who caused the Sacred Timeline to branch after killing He Who Remains. Loki and Mobius meet TVA technician Ouroboros, who deduces that Loki is "time slipping", a phenomenon possibly caused by branching timelines dangerously overloading the Temporal Loom. To save Loki, Ouroboros instructs Mobius to approach the Temporal Loom with the Temporal Aura Extractor device to extract Loki from the time stream as Loki prunes himself. Loki time slips to the future, where the TVA is being evacuated as the Loom goes critical, he encounters Sylvie before he is pruned by someone at the last minute. In the present, Mobius successfull
           y pulls Loki from the time stream, and they set out to find Sylvie. In a mid-credits scene, Sylvie enters a branched timeline in Broxton, Oklahoma, 1982 and visits a McDonald's restaurant.
