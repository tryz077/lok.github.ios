              Season 1:
The first season of Loki follows the story of the titular character played by Tom Hiddleston,
 who is a variant of the God of Mischief created when he steals the Tesseract during the events of Avengers: Endgame. Loki is apprehended by the Time Variance Authority (TVA),
 an organization that governs the multiverse and maintains the proper flow of time.

Loki is put on trial for his crimes of disrupting the sacred timeline,
 but he manages to escape with the TVA's specialized agent, Mobius M. Mobius (played by Owen Wilson). Loki learns about the existence of alternate timelines and different versions of himself known as variants. Together with Mobius, they try to catch a dangerous variant who is causing chaos across the timeline.

Throughout the season, Loki goes through a transformative journey, questioning his identity and purpose. He encounters different variants of himself, including a female Loki variant named Sylvie (played by Sophia Di Martino), with whom he forms a unique bond. They uncover a conspiracy within the TVA and discover the true nature of the multiverse.

In a thrilling finale, Loki and Sylvie confront the mastermind behind the TVA, a variant of Loki known as "He Who Remains" (played by Jonathan Majors). They are given a crucial choice that will affect the fate of the multiverse. Ultimately, Sylvie kills He Who Remains, causing the multiverse to branch out into infinite timelines.
